# Netlify Auth & Sanity Data

A bare minimum app that allows a Netlify identity user to sign up, log in, and securely read and write data scoped to their user in a private Sanity datastore.

This repo is *not* something you should fork to use for your next production project.  It's just a thing I made to learn/demonstrate one way this can work.

## Outline of how it works

### Signing Up 

1. Front End User signs up with [Netlify identity widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget) and confirms their email
2. Front end user gets a token, and at the same time netlify sends the new user's id to Sanity.  Sanity creates a document mapped to the Netlify user by id.

### Reading and Writing User-Scoped Data

1. Front End requests the users stuff, presenting token to netlify function
2. Netlify (with Sanity key in server-side ENV var) uses user info in token and queries Sanity for the user's data
3. Sanity sends the user's stuff  back to a serverless function
4. The serverless function returns it to the browser

### Some Details

This is for demonstration purposes, so it has some slow, but simple-on-the-brain patterns like:

- No frontend framework nor front-end compilation steps
- Standard browser `fetch()` calls that only result in UI updates when the new data is really back from Sanity. 
- The npm stuff you see in the top-level directory is there for Netlify functions to access when this is deployed

## Where's the Sanity part? 

It's [this repo](https://github.com/bacalj/authy-studio) but there's not much to see.  It's an out-of-the-box Sanity studio.  The document schemas for the studio are pasted below for quick reference.  

### note.js

```js

import { MdNote } from 'react-icons/md'

export default {
  name: 'note',
  title: 'Notes',
  type: 'document',
  icon: MdNote,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      title: 'Title',
      type: 'string',
    },
    {
      name: 'belongsTo',
      title: 'User',
      type: 'reference',
      to: [ { type: 'webUser' } ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### webUser.js

```js
import { MdPerson } from 'react-icons/md'

export default {
  name: 'webUser',
  title: 'Website Users',
  type: 'document',
  icon: MdPerson,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'email',
      title: 'Email',
      type: 'string'
    },
    {
      name: 'fullName',
      title: 'Full Name',
      type: 'string'
    }
  ]
}

```
